Additional information about each metric is represented as charts or graphs on the screen, and describes the following elements:

- A graphical representation of the number of occurrences of an event (such as a violation or an incident) versus time intervals (starting from the current day and going back 90 days). The dots on the graph provide the number of events for a component on a particular day (in this case, there were 122 violations on March 29th). In addition, the percentage of Components Reporting data is displayed in a percentage wheel. The color coding is explained as follows:

  | Color Code | Percentage range of Components Reporting |
  |------------|------------------------------------------|
  | Red | 0 to 25% |
  | Yellow | 26 to 49% |
  | Green | 50 to 100% |

- The event **Breakdown** with block, critical, or major severity level for all components in a product
- List of all **Components** for a product in the portfolio

Once you have finished viewing the component level details, click **Back** to return to the [**Portfolio**](Portfolio_Metrics.md) screen.
